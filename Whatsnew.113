What's new in Xtacy 1.13:

New modes:
	-cells  Cells of color.. looks like a tile floor

	-mixer  Swirls of color

	-taffy  Multi-colored stretched taffy

	-dogplasma  A different mode, sort of like Plasma.
		    Acidwarp 4.06 has a similar mode.

	-bezier  Bouncing Bezier curves.

	-swarm   Swarming bees, playing follow the leader

	-cube  Spinning wireframe cube

New palettes:

	-pal 4  Starts as a greyscale, then drops random colors and
		smooths out

	-pal 5  interpolated between 3 random colors
 
Bug fixes:

	fixed a couple of memory leaks in generating some of the shapes.

	the starback works now

New Stuff:

	running Xtacy with no arguments gives you a random mode
	(not just -kaleid anymore).  Including some of the undocumented
	modes.  I'd say what those where, but that would be documenting...
