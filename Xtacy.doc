(ok, this is the cheesy plain text, no frills, not even much info doc file
 for Xtacy.  If someone is stuck by a muse and wants to write up a better one,
 I'd more than welcome it.  -jj)

and now...

a bit of explanation.

the mouse buttons:

Left Button: rotates the colormap one step, except on:
	     -gravity, where it places a new particle.
	     -wander, where it moves the pixel
	     -swarm, where it moves the queen

Middle Button: Resets the window, redraws whatever it was doing.

Right Button: Closes the window. If it's the last window, exits the program.
		If the -lock option is on, this brings up the Keyhole Window

the command line switches:

Options:

-annoy : turns on the Zoomy Close Window thing.  

-bw : Border Width. Specifies the width of the border around your window,
      in Pixels.

-cycles : Instead of running forever, only runs through N times, then exits.
	I've included this for those people who are using Xtacy to
	test frame-buffer systems.

-delay : Delay between loops, in Microseconds.

-display : opens an Xtacy window on the given display

-geometry : sets the geometry for the Xtacy window. in the form "XVALxYVAL"

-lock : prompts you for a key, then locks the window until the key is entered
	again. Caution: I don't guarantee the security of this. 

-mirrors : In some modes, this will mirror the output to other
	 parts of the window.  No, this isn't in the help screen,
	 it's a special feature for you, the DOC Reader. :)

-number :  These two send two numbers as parameters into the functions.
-opt :     Use them to trigger different behaviours


-r OR -root : Runs XTacy in the Root Window

-rillybig: Runs XTacy in a really big window (1024x860)

-windows: lets you specify the number of different windows Xtacy opens
	  for itself.

Color Options:

-bd : lets you specify the border color of the Xtacy window

-bg : lets you specify the background color of the Xtacy window

-mono : runs with a greyscale palette

-multi : rotates the colormap on most modes.

-few : uses only 18 colors

-several : uses 72 colors

-colors : lets you specify how many colors to try for.

-rand OR -randomcolor : scrambles the colormap

-perfect : makes Xtacy very greedy about colors. You must have the cursor in 
	   the Xtacy window to use those colors. This'll do funky things to
	   the rest of the screen.

-pal : lets you pick a palette. At the moment, there are 6.
	palette 0: default RYGCBM. Rotating straight.
	palette 1: 3 bands, 1 red, 1 green, 1 blue, each of which can rotate
		   independantly
	palette 2: grayscale. The red,green,and blue components can rotate
		   independantly
	palette 3: chooses 2 colors, and interpolates between them
	palette 4: starts with a greyscale palette, then drops in a
		   random color and smooths around it
	palette 5: chooses 3 random colors, and interpolates them

	you can also specify a Palette File, which is just a text file
	with R-G-B triples ranging from 0 to 255.  A few demonstration
	palette files are included in the Xtacy distribution, in the
	palette directory.


Different Modes:

-bez :  Bouncing Bezier curves.

-boxes : Bouncing Boxes

-bozo : Bouncing Quadrilaterals (Bozogons <G>)

-circ : Bouncing Circles. Kinda reminds me of Sesame Street

-qix : Qix

-qix4 : 4 Qixes, mirrored on each other.

	with these 6, the option -number NUMBER will let you select how many
	there are.

-blur : starts with randomly placed boxes, and then blurs the edges
      between them.

-cells :  Tile floor, cells of rotating color.
	-number sets the size

-clover : Lines rotating around a center point

-cube : a spinning wireframe cube
	you may want to push up the delay to slow this down on
	a fast system

-dcurve : plots the colors based on the distance to the curve(s)

-dline : plots colors based on the distance to the line(s)

-dog   :  DogPlasma mode. 
	-number sets the graininess.

-field : Displays E-Fields between random points of random intensity.
	-number sets the number of points

-flush : starts with randomly drawn boxes, and moves them towards
       the center of the window

-fracrect : ever decreasing squares-within-squares

-funky : Shapes spiraling down to the center point
	-number lets you set the shape.
	       0 is a straight line
	       1 is a square
	       2 is a triangle

-gravity : Gravity Well simulator
	-number sets the number of wells. -part set the number of roaming
	particles

-julia : Julia set fractal

-kaleid : Kaleidascope.
	-norect turns off everything but the lines.
	(use the -mirrors <num> options with Kaleid, it looks
	 neat! )

-life  :  Conway's game of Life
	-number sets the starting density

-lunch :  A reminder to go eat in the middle of the day

-mandel : Mandelbrot set fractal

-max : Max Headroom's background  (Max not included)

-newton : Newton root fractal
	with these three, -number sets the number of iterations

-mixer :  Displays swirls of colors.
	-number sets the width of the bands (try -number 20)

-off : Off the Air color test pattern

-plasma : Plasma cloud
	-number sets the graniness of the cloud (high number is smoother)
	-trell puts it in Trellace mode, which started as a bug, but
	looked neat enough to stay.
	(also try the -mirror flag with this ) 

-rose : Phased sine waves 

-spiral : Draws a spiral

-star : runs a Starfield pattern.
	-number determines the number of stars onscreen at a time.
	-opt 1 will make the stars follow the mouse pointer

-static : draws static
	use -mono to get Black and White static

-sunrise :  umm.. kinda looks like the sunrise :)

-swarm : draws a swarm of bees playing follow the leader.

-taffy : a mod of the mixer mode
	-number sets the width of the bands (try -number 20)

-tag :  sort of the reverse of 'swarm'  everyone avoids the leader.
     and the leader tries to tag the closest bee

-test : Displays the colormap

-tunnel : Displays a tunnel

-wander : Displays a squiggly line, wandering around the screen.
